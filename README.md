# Medical Image Classification (Chest X-Rays)

##  Objective
Build a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images into **Normal** and **Pneumonia** classes.

##  Tools & Skills
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- Image Preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Model Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve)
- Explainability (Grad-CAM visualization)

##  Dataset
- **Kaggle Dataset**: [Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

##  Approach
1. Load & preprocess X-ray images.
2. Train a CNN model for binary classification.
3. Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1.
4. Apply **Grad-CAM** to visualize which parts of the lung influenced predictions.

##  Expected Output
- Classification accuracy > 80%.
- Visualizations showing CNN attention maps.
